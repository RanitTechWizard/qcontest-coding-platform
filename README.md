# QContest Coding Platform

The QContest Coding Platform is a Java-based system designed to manage coding contests, questions, and participants. This platform provides functionality for creators to design contests, contestants to participate and solve questions, and users to interact with the system.

## Features

- **Contest Management:** Creators can design and add contests, specifying difficulty levels and questions.
- **Question Management:** Questions can be added with titles, difficulty levels, and scores. They can also be organized by difficulty.
- **User Roles:** The platform supports different user roles, including Creators and Contestants.
- **Contest Participation:** Contestants can participate in contests, solve questions, and earn points.
- **Leaderboard:** The system provides a way to view user scores and contest rankings.
- **Command-Based Interface:** The platform is operated using commands that trigger actions such as creating contests, solving questions, and more.
